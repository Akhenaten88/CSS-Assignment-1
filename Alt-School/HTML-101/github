    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Akhenaten Jama. I was born and raised in Somalia, lived a couple of years in Kenya where i
      was schooled and then went to Sweden where i live and work now. My current job isn't that fulfilling job and i 
      was hoping to level up my tech knowledge or skills, where i'm currently lacking any tech skills or know how.
      I am a passionate learner and an aspiring front-end engineer.
     I hope to achieve my desired goals when i finish this course at AltSchool come next year.
